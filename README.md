## This repository contains a collection of small but powerful scripts I personally use for daily tasks, automation, and system management. 

- These scripts are designed to:

	- Speed up repetitive or manual tasks

	- Help with productivity and workflow automation

	- Work on Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS)
